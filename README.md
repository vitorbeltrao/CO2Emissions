## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using environmental and country's data to better understand:

1. Which countries have the highest emissions per capita in the most recent year?
2. Among the countries listed in question (1), we want the twenty countries that have the largest populations, together with their respective GDP?
3. For the countries listed in question (2), we want to know the changes over time over a twenty-year interval?
4. In addition to analyzing the highest per capita emissions of the twenty countries with the largest populations, we want to know the annual emissions of these countries in the most recent year?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 1 exploratory notebook available here to showcase work related to the above environmental questions. 

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://pandascouple.medium.com/an%C3%A1lise-dos-dados-de-emiss%C3%A3o-de-co2-no-planeta-5e41985fd23e).
